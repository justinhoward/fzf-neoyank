OPTIONS                                               *fzf-neoyank-options*

                                                      *g:fzf_neoyank_register*

The default register to view with the |:FZFNeoyank| command.
Default: `"`

                                                      *g:fzf_neoyank_command*

KEY MAPPINGS                                          *fzf-neoyank-key-mappings*

fzf-neoyank does not setup any key mappings by default. Some useful mappings
might be:
>
  nnoremap <leader>y :FZFNeoyank<cr>
  nnoremap <leader>Y :FZFNeoyank " P<cr>
  vnoremap <leader>y :FZFNeoyankSelection<cr>

These mappings sets up <leader>y to put from the default register. If you are in
normal mode, it puts after the cursor. If you are in visual mode, it replaces
the selection.

It also sets up <leader>Y (uppercase) to put after the cursor in normal mode.
